## Database Connection

#### Create Database:

Start SQL Server Management Studio and connect to the SQL Server instance and create a database called PROJETO_VB;

#### Adding the Connection String

Open the Web.config File, if your Web.config already contains a <connectionStrings> section, you can add your connection string within it.

#### Adding the Database Connection Class

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01c94883-d656-4c2f-818b-a2ad84c19e2b)

- The CustomDbContext class is declared as Public, meaning it can be accessed from other parts of the application.
- The class inherits from DbContext, which is the base class for working with Entity Framework. DbContext provides methods for querying and saving data to the database.
- The constructor Sub New() is defined to initialize the CustomDbContext class.
- The MyBase.New("name=ConnectProjetoDB") line calls the base class constructor and passes the name of the connection string ("ConnectProjetoDB"). This connection string is defined in the application's configuration file (e.g., web.config or app.config), and it specifies the database connection details.
- The OnModelCreating method is overridden to provide custom configuration for the model (entities) when the model is being created.
- The method receives an instance of DbModelBuilder as a parameter, which is used to configure the model's structure (e.g., entity relationships, property configurations).
- The MyBase.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder) line calls the base implementation of the method, ensuring that any default behavior is preserved unless explicitly overridden.


##### Enable Migrations 

If you haven't enabled migrations yet, do so in Visual Studio's Package Manager Console:

```
Enable-Migrations -ContextTypeName CrudVB.CustomDbContext
```

# Project Documentation

## Create Models

Creating models in VB.NET using the Code-First approach with Entity Framework involves defining your database schema through classes in your application code, rather than starting with a pre-existing database.

#### Define the Model Classes:

Models are simple classes that represent entities in your application, and each class corresponds to a table in the database.

#### Add model in the DbContext Class  

The DbContext class is responsible for managing the database connection and mapping the model classes to database tables.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a25c9b87-832e-4a7a-be04-a1b280c31d24)

  
#### Configure the Model (Optional) 

Use the OnModelCreating method in the DbContext class to configure model relationships, constraints, and other database schema details.

#### Database Initialization 

When you first run the application, Entity Framework will generate a database based on the defined models and context and Migrations can be used to apply changes to the database schema over time.

#### Perform CRUD Operations  

You can now use the context to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on your models using LINQ:

### Create Models : One to Many 

#### Setting Up the Classes (Models)

Let's assume you are creating a system to manage Orders and Order Items. Each Order can have multiple Order Items, but each Order Item belongs to a single Order.

##### Many orders can belong to one material

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8468901-ec55-4010-b703-56e0a13b0583)

##### One material belongs to many orders

#### Configuring the DbContext

Next, you need to configure the DbContext to include these models.

#### Migrations and Database Creation

- Create a Migration: In the Package Manager Console, run the following command to create a migration

```
  Add-Migration <MigrationName>
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cde54f62-0cae-4d23-b54d-6b840afc7dd9)

- Update the Database: After creating the migration, apply the changes to the database by running:

```
Update-Database
```

## Migration Structure:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/000cc346-354b-433e-8921-09bedb182937)

- up() Method: Defines the operations to be performed when the migration is applied, such as creating a table.
- down() Method: Defines the operations to revert the changes performed by the up() method, such as deleting a table.

#### Creating Migrations:

Add-Migration <MigrationName> : Creates a new migration file based on changes made to the model.

#### Run Migrations:

Update-Database :  Applies all pending migrations to the database.

#### Check Migration Status:

Get-Migrations : Lists all migrations that have been added to the project.

#### Update Tables:

Update-Database : Applies migrations to the database, updating the tables.

#### Add Fields:

Add-Migration <MigrationName> : Creates a new migration after adding new fields to the model.

#### Apply Changes:

Update-Database : Applies recent changes to the database  


## Template Inheritance

In ASP.NET MVC, template inheritance allows you to create a base layout or template that other views can inherit from, promoting reusability and consistency across your application. Here's how you can set up and use template inheritance in VB.NET MVC:
 
#### Layout (Master Page):

First, a layout page will serve as the base template for other views. This layout page typically includes common elements like headers, footers, and navigation menus.

The base template it's called _Layout.vbhtml

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d7bb2c0-bf53-4690-b88e-68d5220eb6ce)


#### Rendering Content

In your individual views, specify the layout page using the Layout property or use the base layout. This tells the view to use the specified layout page.

## Controller

#### Creating a Controller:

With Entity Framework, creating a controller based on a model is a very straightforward process. Here are the steps to create a controller that uses the Entity Framework to manipulate data from a model:

## Actions

#### Index():

- HTTP GET: Retrieves and displays a list of all MaterialMovel records from the database.
Returns a view with the list of MaterialMovels.]
- Route: MaterialMovels

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32d4dbeb-ec64-4529-b84c-a18f1cf6ace1)


#### Details(ByVal id As Integer?):

- HTTP GET: Displays details of a specific MaterialMovel identified by the id.
If id is Nothing, it returns a BadRequest status. If the MaterialMovel is not found, it returns a HttpNotFound status. Otherwise, it returns the view with the details.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Details/5

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67ff3219-cdcb-469e-9c00-8b952f6764c4)


#### Create():

- HTTP GET: Returns the view for creating a new MaterialMovel.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Create
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fa0fc9f-8551-46f5-8b96-95764343718f)


#### Create(ByVal materialMovel As MaterialMovel):

- HTTP POST: Handles the submission of the form to create a new MaterialMovel.
It uses model binding to populate the materialMovel object. If the model state is valid, the new entity is added to the database and saved, then redirects to the Index action. If the model state is invalid, it returns the view with the current materialMovel data for corrections.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Create

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec7d53-64e4-4a98-b61e-f371ed633f9b)

  
#### Edit(ByVal id As Integer?):

- HTTP GET: Retrieves and displays the edit form for an existing MaterialMovel identified by id.
Similar to Details, it checks if id is valid and if the MaterialMovel exists before returning the view.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Edit/5

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee62892-7a8b-429a-952e-44b299c5a589)


#### Edit(ByVal materialMovel As MaterialMovel):

- HTTP POST: Handles form submissions to update an existing MaterialMovel.
Updates the entity in the database if the model state is valid, and then redirects to the Index action. If the model state is invalid, it returns the view with the current data.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Edit/5
  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18fa0d07-8e7d-4790-a0d3-e34e3673063e)

#### Delete(ByVal id As Integer?):

- HTTP GET: Displays a confirmation page for deleting a specific MaterialMovel identified by id.
Checks if id is valid and if the MaterialMovel exists before returning the view.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Delete/5

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42c2ca76-073d-4921-8635-1083c116d7e7)


#### DeleteConfirmed(ByVal id As Integer):

- HTTP POST: Handles the deletion of a MaterialMovel identified by id.
Finds the entity, removes it from the database, and saves the changes. Redirects to the Index action after deletion.
- Route: MaterialMovels/Delete/5

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beff7d42-db91-4a65-b409-071c7f68f103)


## Routes

Routes are defined in the application configuration, usually in the RegisterRoutes method within the RouteConfig module or a similar file.
Each route is made up of a URL pattern and rules to direct a request to a specific driver and action.

#### URL Pattern:

The URL pattern is a template that describes the structure of URLs accepted by rotation, such as {controller}/{action}/{id}.
In the standard, {controller} is the name of the driver, {action} is the name of the action (driver method), and {id} is an optional parameter.

##### Route Mapping:

Routes are mapped to controllers and actions in the application. When a request arrives, the routing system compares the URL against defined URL patterns.
If a URL matches a route pattern, the request is directed to the driver and action specified in the route.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4425c40-af78-4a4a-a529-b857ccc5e8aa)

###### Route pattern:

- Route: MaterialMovels
- Route: MaterialMovels/Details/5
- Route: MaterialMovels/Create
- Route: MaterialMovels/Edit/5
- Route: MaterialMovels/Delete/5

#### Default Values â€‹â€‹and Parameters:

You can set default values â€‹â€‹for rotation settings and specify which settings are specific.
If a URL does not provide all settings, the default values â€‹â€‹are used.

#### Request Processing:

The routing system intercepts the HTTP request, parses the URL, and uses routing rules to determine which driver and action should process the request.
The corresponding controller is instantiated, and the action method is called to generate the corresponding response.
